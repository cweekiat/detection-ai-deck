# detection-ai-deck
Performs object detection on AI-deck

## Installation
Clone into aideck-gap8-examples/examples/other

From a terminal with the docker container, or gap_sdk dev environment, in the aideck-gap8-examples/ folder, execute:

'''docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/module aideck-with-autotiler tools/build/make-example examples/other/detection clean model build image'''

Then from another terminal (outside of the container), use the cfloader to flash the example if you have the gap8 bootloader flashed AIdeck. Change the [CRAZYFLIE URI] with your crazyflie URI like radio://0/40/2M/E7E7E7E703

'''cfloader flash examples/other/detection/BUILD/GAP8_V2/GCC_RISCV_FREERTOS/target.board.devices.flash.img deck-bcAI:gap8-fw -w [CRAZYFLIE URI]'''
When the example is flashing, you should see the GAP8 LED blink fast, which is the bootloader. The example itself can be noticed by a slow blinking LED. You should also receive the detection output in the cfclient console.
